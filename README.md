Interactables API - Create Executable Objects in Minecraft Bukkit
------------------------------------------------------------------

Interactables is a fully featured API that allows the creation of executable objects in Minecraft.
Interactables is the API used in plugins such as PortalCommands, which creates portals that when
stepped through, execute a command and/or send a message.  The Interactables API takes this idea of
executing commands and messages, and allows it to be brought to other types of objects in Minecraft.
